    abstract={The recovery of morphologically accurate anatomical images from deformed ones is challenging in ultrasound (US) image acquisition, but crucial to accurate and consistent diagnosis, particularly in the emerging field of computer-assisted diagnosis. This article presents a novel anatomy-aware deformation correction approach based on a coarse-to-fine, multi-scale deep neural network (DefCor-Net). To achieve pixel-wise performance, DefCor-Net incorporates biomedical knowledge by estimating pixel-wise stiffness online using a U-shaped feature extractor. The deformation field is then computed using polynomial regression by integrating the measured force applied by the US probe. Based on real-time estimation of pixel-by-pixel tissue properties, the learning-based approach enables the potential for anatomy-aware deformation correction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DefCor-Net, images recorded at multiple locations on forearms and upper arms of six volunteers are used to train and validate DefCor-Net. The results demonstrate that DefCor-Net can significantly improve the accuracy of deformation correction to recover the original geometry (Dice Coefficient: from 14.3±20.9 to 82.6±12.1 when the force is 6N).}

   abstract={Tissue deformation in ultrasound (US) imaging leads
to geometrical errors when measuring tissues due to the pressure
exerted by probes. Such deformation has an even larger effect
on 3D US volumes as the correct compounding is limited by the
inconsistent location and geometry. This work proposes a patient-
specified stiffness-based method to correct the tissue deformations
in robotic 3D US acquisitions. To obtain the patient-specified
model, robotic palpation is performed at sampling positions on
the tissue. The contact force, US images and the probe poses of
the palpation procedure are recorded. The contact force and the
probe poses are used to estimate the nonlinear tissue stiffness.
The images are fed to an optical flow algorithm to compute
the pixel displacement. Then the pixel-wise tissue deformation
under different forces is characterized by a coupled quadratic
regression. To correct the deformation at unseen positions on the
trajectory for building 3D volumes, an interpolation is performed
based on the stiffness values computed at the sampling positions.
With the stiffness and recorded force, the tissue displacement
could be corrected. The method was validated on two blood vessel
phantoms with different stiffness. The results demonstrate that
the method can effectively correct the force-induced deformation
and finally generate 3D tissue geometries.}
